# rowing-cox-box

# Overview

This code script is for a rowing 'cox box' (the device used in rowing to measure/track strokes per minute, total strokes, stopwatch time, etc.) The goal here is to improve the current iteration of the device using a Raspberry Pi 3 and a custom Python code with touchscreen GUI.
